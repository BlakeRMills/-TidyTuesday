# Tidy-Tuesday
A collection of the plots I have made for [#TidyTuesdays] (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). All of the code for the visualizations are included in the original files. All of the visualizations are also posted on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BlakeRobMills). Download the file for the best resolution!

## [Lemurs (24 Aug 2021)](https://twitter.com/BlakeRobMills/status/1430352785506193414)
This was my first every #TidyTuesday posting. The visualization displays the average number of offspring and lifespan of different taxonomies of lemurs. I wanted to try an alternative to traditional legend, hence the colored words in the subtitle. This color scheme is based on the Moonrise3 palette from the `{wesanderson}` palette, however, I made some slight devations to color to fit what I was looking for.
