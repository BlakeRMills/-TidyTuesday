## [#30DayMapChallenge Lines (2 Nov 2021)](https://twitter.com/BlakeRobMills/status/1455691876091170820)
This week's #TidyTuesday was a crossover with the[#30DayMapChallenge](https://twitter.com/tjukanov) on Twitter. My full #30DayMapChallenge repository can be found [here](https://github.com/BlakeRMills/30DayMapChallenge). NOTE: The original post had an error with the London lanes, but it has not been corrected.

## [Nursing Salaries (5 Oct 2021)](https://twitter.com/BlakeRobMills/status/1445624608099487747)
For this week, I chose to finally use the {gganimate} package. Just a simple plot showing the changes in average annual salaries of nurses by state over time. Nothing too crazy, but I wanted to really focus on learning the ropes of making a gif in R.

## [NBER Papers (28 Sept 2021)](https://twitter.com/BlakeRobMills/status/1443047560034275329)
Another week using a new plot. I was excited to check this out. I found this data a little hard to visualize, but I still think I go the point across, showing the popularity of paper topics over time.

## [Emmy Awards (21 Sept 2021)](https://twitter.com/BlakeRobMills/status/1440524242416660493)
I was very happy with how this plot came out. This is one of the few times I knew exactly what I wanted to do when I got the data for the week. This shows the number of awards and nominations of the top companies for Emmy Awards from 2015 to 2021. This is also my first time using a darker background. I usually like a lighter plot, but I feel like this is more fitting. Also got to use the dot plot function for the first time, so this was all new for me!

## [Billboard (14 Sept 2021)](https://twitter.com/BlakeRobMills/status/1438029819262947328)
These graphs show how ABBA's top songs compare to other songs in the Billboard 100 at the time of their chart topers. This color scheme was based around the Voulez-Vous cover of ABBA. There are some tweaks that I would love to make if I ever re-do this plot; however, I am glad to able to represent my favorite band of all time with this week's Tidy Tuesday.

## [Grand Prix (7 Sept 2021)](https://twitter.com/BlakeRobMills/status/1435465430060130306)
This plot shows the differences between starting positions and finishing position of racers in the Monaco Grand Prix of all time. This color scheme is based around a poster for the Monaco Grand Prix from the 70s. Still in the habit of a different forms of scatter plots, but ready to expand

## [Australian Birds (31 Aug 2021)](https://twitter.com/BlakeRobMills/status/1432853452418437125)
This visualization was meant to show the differences in the percentage of times some of the most popular species of birds were seen in urban and rural settings. The larger shapes represent the region average while the smaller points are individual observations. I based this color scheme around the Rainbow Lorikeet. This plot was similar to my last, but I felt it was a decenet represenation of the data.

## [Lemurs (24 Aug 2021)](https://twitter.com/BlakeRobMills/status/1430352785506193414)
This was my first every #TidyTuesday posting. The visualization displays the average number of offspring and lifespan of different taxonomies of lemurs. I wanted to try an alternative to traditional legend, hence the colored words in the subtitle. This color scheme is based on the Moonrise3 palette from the `{wesanderson}` palette, however, I made some slight devations to color to fit what I was looking for.
